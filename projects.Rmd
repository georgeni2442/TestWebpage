1. Study the effect of winter temperatures and microhabitat conditions on EAB parasitoids and their parasitism success 

2. Investigate the use of machine learning and drone imagery as a fieldwork methodology/substitute for traditional field transect surveys when evaluating EAB damage and ash forest health. 

3. Model the dispersal and spread of EAB parasitoids as a response to invasion waves through meta-analysis methods.
